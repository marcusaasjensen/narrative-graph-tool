## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Unity | 6.0+ |
| [Graph Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.graphtoolkit@0.4/manual/index.html) | 0.4.0-exp.2 |

> ⚠️ Graph Toolkit is an **experimental** Unity package. You must add it manually before installing this package.

---

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Add Graph Toolkit

> ⚠️ UPM does **not** auto-install dependencies from git URL packages — you must add Graph Toolkit manually before step 2, or you will get compile errors.

Open `Packages/manifest.json` and add the dependency:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.unity.graphtoolkit": "0.4.0-exp.2"
  }
}
```

### 2. Add Narrative Graph Tool via Package Manager

Go to **Window → Package Manager → + → Add package from git URL** and paste:

```
https://github.com/marcusaasjensen/narrative-graph-tool.git
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create a Narrative Graph asset

Right-click in the **Project window → Create → Narrative Graph Tool → Narrative Graph**.

### 2. Open the graph editor

Double-click the `.narrativegraph` asset to open it in the graph editor.

### 3. Build your narrative

Add a **StartNode**, connect it to **NarrativeLineNodes** and **EndNodes**, wire up choices — the graph is automatically parsed and saved as a runtime `NarrativeGraphData` sub-asset whenever you save.

### 4. Set up the runner

Add a **NarrativeRunner** component to a GameObject, drag your `.narrativegraph` file into the **Graph Data** field.

### 5. Subscribe to events and drive your UI

```csharp
[SerializeField] NarrativeRunner runner;

void Start()
{
    runner.OnLine   += line   => Debug.Log($"{line.speaker}: {line.text}");
    runner.OnChoice += opts   => ShowChoiceUI(opts);
    runner.OnEnd    += ()     => Debug.Log("Narrative ended.");

    runner.VariableProvider = id => myVariables[id];
    runner.VariableSetter   = (id, val) => myVariables[id] = val;

    runner.StartNarrative();
}

void Update()
{
    if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space)) runner.Continue();
}
```

## 🧩 Node Reference

### 🟢 Flow

| Node | Description |
|---|---|
| **Start** | Entry point of the narrative. Every graph needs exactly one. |
| **End** | Terminates the narrative and fires `OnEnd`. |

---

### 💬 Lines

| Node | Description |
|---|---|
| **NarrativeLine** | Displays a single line with a speaker, text, and optional metadata. Fires `OnLine`. |
| **RevisitableLine** | Displays different text on first visit vs. subsequent visits. Fires `OnLine`. |
| **NarrativeContext** | Groups a sequence of lines into a block. Fires `OnBlock` with all lines at once. |

> ℹ️ **NarrativeContext** is a container node — add **LineBlock** children inside it.

---

### 🔀 Choices

| Node | Description |
|---|---|
| **ChoiceContext** | Presents a list of choices to the player. Fires `OnChoice`. |
| **ConditionalBoolChoice** | A choice that only appears when a bool variable matches. |
| **ConditionalIntChoice** | A choice that only appears when an int variable matches a condition. |
| **ConditionalFloatChoice** | A choice that only appears when a float variable matches a condition. |
| **ConditionalStringChoice** | A choice that only appears when a string variable matches a condition. |

> ℹ️ **ChoiceContext** is a container node — add **ChoiceBlock** or conditional choice children inside it.

---

### 🔵 Conditionals

Branch the flow based on a variable's value.

| Node | Compares |
|---|---|
| **ConditionalBoolean** | Bool variable |
| **ConditionalInteger** | Int variable with: `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` |
| **ConditionalFloat** | Float variable with: `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` |
| **ConditionalString** | String variable with: `==` `!=` `Contains` |

All conditional nodes have a **True** and **False** output port.

---

### 📝 Set Variable

Modify a variable as the narrative flows through. Execution continues automatically.

| Node | Operations |
|---|---|
| **SetVariableBool** | `Set`, `Toggle` |
| **SetVariableInt** | `Set`, `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply` |
| **SetVariableFloat** | `Set`, `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply` |
| **SetVariableString** | `Set`, `Append` |

---

### 🎲 Random Branch

| Node | Description |
|---|---|
| **RandomBranchContext** | Picks one of its **RandomBranchBlock** children at random and continues from there. |

---

### ⚡ Events

| Node | Description |
|---|---|
| **Event** | Fires `OnEvent` with a name and optional string payload, then continues. Use this to trigger gameplay effects (play sound, unlock item, etc.) without breaking narrative flow. |

---

### 🏷️ Jump & Target

| Node | Description |
|---|---|
| **Jump** | Teleports execution to a **Target** node by name. |
| **Target** | A named anchor that execution can jump to. |

> 💡 Use Jump/Target for loops or shared nodes you want to revisit from multiple places.

---

## ⚙️ NarrativeRunner API

### C# Events

Subscribe from code for full typed access to node data:

```csharp
// A single narrative line is ready to display
runner.OnLine += (NarrativeLineData line) => { };

// A sequential block of lines is ready to display
runner.OnBlock += (NarrativeBlockData block) => { };

// A choice menu should be shown — contains only the visible choices
runner.OnChoice += (ChoiceNodeData data) => { };

// An event node was reached — use name + payload for gameplay hooks
runner.OnEvent += (EventNodeData ev) => { };

// The narrative has ended
runner.OnEnd += () => { };
```

---

### 🔌 Unity Events (Inspector)

Every C# event has an Inspector-wirable **UnityEvent** equivalent, visible under the **Unity Events** header on the `NarrativeRunner` component. Wire up any method directly in the Inspector — no code required.

| Unity Event | Equivalent C# event | Parameter |
|---|---|---|
| `_onLine` | `OnLine` | `NarrativeLineData` |
| `_onBlock` | `OnBlock` | `NarrativeBlockData` |
| `_onChoice` | `OnChoice` | `ChoiceNodeData` |
| `_onEvent` | `OnEvent` | `EventNodeData` |
| `_onNarrativeEnd` | `OnEnd` | — |
| `_onNodeEnter` | — | `NarrativeNodeData` |
| `_onNodeExit` | — | `NarrativeNodeData` |

> ℹ️ `_onNodeEnter` and `_onNodeExit` fire for **every** node — useful for driving animations, audio, or analytics without caring about the specific node type. In the Inspector, select the **Dynamic** version of a method to receive the node as a parameter, or wire a no-parameter method to ignore it.

---

### Controlling flow

```csharp
runner.StartNarrative();          // Begin from StartNode
runner.Continue();                // Advance past a line or block
runner.SelectChoice(index);       // Choose an option (0-based, filtered index)
runner.SetGraphData(data);        // Swap graph data at runtime
runner.ResetVisitedNodes();       // Clear visit history
```

---

### Variables

Provide callbacks so the runner can read and write your game's variables:

```csharp
// Called when a conditional or set-variable node needs a value
runner.VariableProvider = (string id) => myVariables[id];

// Called when a set-variable node writes a value
runner.VariableSetter = (string id, object value) => myVariables[id] = value;
```

> 💡 Variable IDs are plain strings you define in the graph nodes — they map to whatever storage system your game uses (Dictionary, ScriptableObjects, PlayerPrefs, etc.)

---

### State

```csharp
bool running                          = runner.IsRunning;
NarrativeNodeData current             = runner.CurrentNode;
IReadOnlyCollection<string> visited   = runner.VisitedNodes;
```

---

## 🎨 Custom Line Metadata

Attach game-specific data to any narrative line (emotion, portrait, audio clip, etc.) by extending `NarrativeLineMetadata`:

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Narrative Graph > My Line Metadata")]
public class MyLineMetadata : NarrativeLineMetadata
{
    public Sprite portrait;
    public AudioClip voiceClip;
    public Color subtitleColor = Color.white;
}
```

Then assign it to a **NarrativeLine** or **NarrativeContext** node in the graph editor, and read it at runtime:

```csharp
runner.OnLine += line =>
{
    if (line.metadata is MyLineMetadata meta)
    {
        portraitImage.sprite = meta.portrait;
        audioSource.PlayOneShot(meta.voiceClip);
    }
};
```

---

## 🧪 Sample

The package includes a ready-to-use example in `Samples/`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `SimpleNarrativeUI.cs` | Minimal console-based runner showing the full API (input, choices, events, variables) |
| `EmotionLineMetadata.cs` | Example metadata with emotion enum, portrait sprite, and voice clip |

> 🕹️ **SimpleNarrativeUI** controls: **Space** to advance, **1–4** keys to select choices.
